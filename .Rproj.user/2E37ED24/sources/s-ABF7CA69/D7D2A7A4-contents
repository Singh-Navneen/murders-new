## R Markdown

This report shows the U.S. Gun murder rates according to the data collected by the FBI.
The following data file is loaded.
```{r cars}
load("murders/rda.rda")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

Here is a bargraph showing murder rates according to the states, from highest to lowest.

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) + geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Note that Washington D.C. has the highest rate and Vermont has the lowest.
